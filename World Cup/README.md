# Day 4 — Whistle-Controlled Car + MQTT World Cup

Whistle at your laptop and the LEGO car obeys: a **high** whistle speeds it up,
a **low** whistle stops it, and the two **middle** bands turn it left or right.
A live window shows the microphone waveform, the FFT spectrum with the command
bands shaded, and the decision being acted on. On top of that sits the World
Cup game: MQTT start signal, light-sensor tagging, score whistle, and
victory/death songs.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `whistle_car.py` | Main assignment: PyAudio stream → FFT pitch policy → motors, with live signal/decision display |
| `worldcup.py` | Game mode (ball or goalie): MQTT start, light-sensor tag-out, score whistle, songs |
| `mqtt_driver.py` | Bonus: two people whistle at their own laptops, MQTT merges both streams onto one robot |
| `songs.py` | Victory / death tone sequences played through PyAudio output |
| `lelib.py`, `mqttlib.py` | Course libraries (LEGO wrappers, MQTT wrapper) |
| `record_spectrogram.py` | Separate exploratory script: live spectrogram of the mic with musical notes labeled on the y-axis (not part of the whistle-car assignment itself) |

## Setup

This folder has its own virtual environment, separate from the repo's main
`my_env` (different libraries, and `pyaudio` needed a much heavier build
chain than anything else here).

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`pyaudio` has no prebuilt wheel for Python 3.14 on Windows yet, so installing
it from source needs two things set up first:

1. **Microsoft C++ Build Tools** (the compiler). Install via winget:
   ```powershell
   winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools -e --override "--wait --quiet --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended"
   ```
2. **PortAudio itself** (the C library pyaudio binds to - not a pip package).
   Install it via [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg):
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git C:\vcpkg
   C:\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
   C:\vcpkg\vcpkg.exe install portaudio:x64-windows
   ```
   Then point pyaudio's build at it and install:
   ```powershell
   $env:VCPKG_PATH = "C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows"
   pip install pyaudio
   ```
   pyaudio links against PortAudio dynamically this way, so
   `C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\bin\portaudio.dll` also needs to be next to
   pyaudio's compiled extension (`venv\Lib\site-packages\pyaudio\`) or on
   `PATH` at runtime - copy it there once after installing:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\bin\portaudio.dll venv\Lib\site-packages\pyaudio\
   ```

macOS notes from the original assignment (not applicable on this Windows
setup, kept for reference): `brew install portaudio`, and macOS will ask for
microphone permission the first time.

## Running

```bash
python whistle_car.py               # drive the car by whistling
python whistle_car.py --no-robot    # audio + policy only, no robot needed
python worldcup.py --role ball      # game day: you are the striker
python worldcup.py --role goalie    # game day: you are the keeper
```

Whistle commands (hold the whistle until the car reacts, ~0.15 s):

| Whistle pitch | Band | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Low (500–900 Hz) | red | **STOP** (instant) |
| Mid-low (900–1400 Hz) | blue | **turn LEFT** (while held) |
| Mid-high (1400–2000 Hz) | green | **turn RIGHT** (while held) |
| High (2000–2700 Hz) | orange | **FORWARD** — dead-man: moves only while whistling, ramping up the longer you hold |
| Top (2700–3500 Hz) | purple | **REVERSE** — dead-man, backs up while whistling; parked at the top of the spectrum, farthest from background noise |

The spectrum plot shows exactly which band your whistle lands in — if your
"low" whistle reads as mid, just adjust the `BANDS` table to your own
whistling range.

## Q1 — Describe the policy: how does it make decisions?

Every ~46 ms audio chunk (2048 samples at 44.1 kHz) goes through the same
pipeline:

1. **FFT** the Hann-windowed chunk and find the strongest frequency peak
   inside the whistle band (500–3500 Hz).
2. **Gate it** (see Q3): the peak must be loud enough, pure enough, and
   persist across 3 consecutive chunks to count as a whistle.
3. **Classify** the surviving pitch into one of four bands → STOP / LEFT /
   RIGHT / FASTER.
4. **Integrate into car state.** The policy keeps two state variables:
   `speed` and `turn`. The throttle is a **dead-man switch**: FORWARD jumps to
   15% the instant the whistle registers (so static friction can't hold the
   car) and ramps 4% per chunk toward 80% while held; REVERSE does the same
   backwards (−18% kick, capped at −40%); STOP zeroes the speed instantly;
   LEFT/RIGHT set a steering offset. All of it lasts only while a whistle is
   actually sounding. Wheel commands are `left = speed ± turn·25`,
   `right = speed ∓ turn·25` — a moving car arcs, a stopped car spins in
   place.
5. A control thread sends the wheel speeds to the two motors over BLE at
   20 Hz (skipping sends when nothing changed).

So unlike Day 3's continuous PD controller, this is a **discrete
event policy with integrated state**: whistles are commands that edit the
car's state, not a signal the car proportionally tracks.

## Q2 — What does your code do if no whistle is detected?

It stops. The throttle is a dead-man switch: no whistle means no motion, so
the moment you stop whistling (or someone else's noise stops passing the
gates), the car coasts for a 0.3 s grace window — just long enough that a
single garbled FFT chunk mid-whistle doesn't stutter it — and then the speed
is zeroed and both motors stop. Steering releases the same way: turns are
only applied while a mid-band whistle is actually sounding. In the World Cup
the car is additionally forced to zero before "start" arrives and after the
game ends. This is the safest possible default for a crowded, noisy game
room: an uncontrolled car is a stationary car.

## Q3 — How did you try to mask out unwanted noise?

Three layers, each catching a different kind of noise:

1. **Band-limiting.** Only 500–3500 Hz can ever trigger a command. That
   discards low-frequency room rumble, fans, motor noise, and the fundamental
   of almost all speech (~85–255 Hz) before classification even starts.
2. **Loudness + purity gates.** The peak must clear an absolute magnitude
   threshold (quiet background tones can't trigger) *and* stand at least 8×
   above the average in-band level. A whistle is a near-pure sine — one tall
   spike on a flat spectrum — while claps, speech, and music spread energy
   across many bins and fail the purity test even when loud.
3. **Persistence.** The same band must win 3 chunks in a row (~140 ms) before
   the command fires, so momentary chirps, squeaky chairs, and FFT flicker
   between adjacent bins get ignored.

The dashed threshold line and the live spectrum in the display make all three
visible — you can watch a clap fail the purity test and a whistle pass it.

## World Cup game (`worldcup.py`)

- Both roles idle (motors frozen) until the message **"start"** arrives on the
  MQTT topic `ME193/Rogers`, then whistle-driving goes live.
- **Ball**: the color/light sensor rides open and facing forward. If the
  goalie holds it over `LIGHT_THRESH` reflection for 0.3 s, the car shuts
  down, publishes `ball:failed` on `ME193/worldcup/chris`, and plays the
  death song. Scoring: hold a **high whistle for 2 s straight** (long enough
  that ordinary speed-up whistles can't fake it) → publishes `ball:scored`
  and plays the victory song.
- **Goalie**: subscribed to the same topic — `ball:failed` triggers the
  victory song on the goalie's laptop, `ball:scored` the death song.
- The topic and the two message strings at the top of `worldcup.py` are the
  "agreed messages" — the opponent's code must use the same three constants.

## Bonus — two mics, one robot (`mqtt_driver.py`)

Both group members stream audio on their **own** computers and control one
robot over MQTT, split by function:

```bash
# person A's laptop (throttle):   python whistle_car.py --no-robot --publish ME193/chris/cmd
# person B's laptop (steering):   python whistle_car.py --no-robot --publish ME193/tasha/cmd
# the laptop near the robot:      python mqtt_driver.py --throttle ME193/chris/cmd --steer ME193/tasha/cmd
```

`whistle_car.py --publish` sends every decision change over MQTT;
`mqtt_driver.py` merges the two streams — A's whistles own speed, B's own
steering — into the same policy/wheel math the single-player car uses.
