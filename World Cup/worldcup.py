"""
Day 4 -- World Cup game mode, built on whistle_car.py.

    python worldcup.py --role ball            # you are the striker
    python worldcup.py --role goalie          # you are the keeper
    add --no-robot to rehearse without the car

Both roles: the car is frozen until the message "start" arrives over
MQTT on ME193/Rogers. After that, normal whistle driving (same policy
and live display as whistle_car.py, with a game-status line added).

BALL role:
  * The color/light sensor rides OPEN and FACING FORWARD on the car.
    If the goalie gets close enough to it (reflection over
    LIGHT_THRESH for ~0.3 s), you are tagged out: motors shut down,
    MSG_FAIL is published on GAME_TOPIC, and the death song plays.
  * If you make it into the goal, blow the SCORE whistle -- a HIGH
    whistle held for SCORE_HOLD_S seconds straight (long enough that
    normal speed-up whistles don't trigger it). That publishes
    MSG_SCORE and plays the victory song.

GOALIE role:
  * Subscribed to GAME_TOPIC: when MSG_FAIL arrives (you tagged the
    ball) your computer sings the victory song; when MSG_SCORE arrives
    (they scored) it plays the death song.

The message strings below are the "agreed messages" -- make sure your
opponent's code uses the same GAME_TOPIC / MSG_FAIL / MSG_SCORE.
